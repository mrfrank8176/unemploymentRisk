This repository hosts unemployment risk data using detailed unemployment statistics from each US state's unemployment benefits office. 
This data includes the number of unemployment benefit recipients per month by most recent occupation (ie., Major SOC code).
An interactive demo using this data is available at www.pitt.edu/~mrfrank/uiRiskDemo .
